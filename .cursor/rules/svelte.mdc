### Guidelines for React

## Guidelines for Modern Svelte Components

- Use `<script lang="ts">`: Write all component logic in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Component Structure: Organize files using the single file component (SFC) pattern (`.svelte`).
- Top-level Exports: Export only props intended to be used by parent components; prefer `export let ...` for inputs.
- Reactivity: Use Svelte's built-in `$:` reactive assignments and stores for state and side effects.
- Styling:
  - Use `<style>` tags with `:global` only where necessary; otherwise, scope styles by default.
- Accessibility:
  - Ensure proper ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
  - Use semantic HTML wherever possible; only add ARIA attributes when there is no semantic equivalent.
- Interactivity:
  - Use the `on:event` syntax for event binding.
  - Use Svelte's built-in `bind:` directive for two-way data binding when relevant.
- Composition:
  - Prefer smaller, composable components over large, monolithic ones.
- Lifecycle: Use Svelte lifecycle hooks (`onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`, `onDestroy`) thoughtfully and only when necessary.
- Accessibility Practices:
  - Apply aria attributes thoughtfully and only where native HTML is insufficient.
  - Provide focus styles and keyboard-accessible controls for interactive elements.
- Performance:
  - Avoid unnecessary reactivity or computations in templates.
  - Use the `svelte:fragment` and `svelte:component` features for advanced component patterns when needed.
- Testing and Linting:
  - Follow feedback from linters and formatting tools.
  - Ensure the component is covered by unit/integration tests where appropriate.

Note: If integrating with frameworks/tools (e.g., Astro, Tailwind), adhere to their integration guidelines as well.
