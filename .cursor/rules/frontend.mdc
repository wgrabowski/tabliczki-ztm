## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components in Svelte only when interactivity is needed

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind
- use CSS files for styles
- in Astro and Svelte components rely on built-in component encapsulation to ensure that clases are not global
- Support light and dark mode with color-theme and light-dark color functions
- use grid for layouts

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Modern features
- make sure that used CSS and HTML features as wel ass browser API are widely available or newly available in Baseline
